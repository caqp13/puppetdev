Facters:

- Puppet's cross-platform system profiling library
- it discovers and reports per-nodes Facters
- then it makes available in puppet manifest as variable


- You have core facts:

facter os.architecture
facter os

etc..
a complete list of core facts can be found at:
https://docs.puppet.com/facter/latest/core_facts.html

================================

use information not available in Facters
Custom facts can be added to Facters
snippets of ruby code


you can use the library $LOAD_PATH or the --custom-dir option or the FACTERLIB environment variable to load a custom facts
